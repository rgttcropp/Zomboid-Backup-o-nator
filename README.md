A simple batch script to backup save folders from Project Zomboid.

I coded this script in a few minutes because I was tired of manually copying the files. It was coded in Portuguese and translated with ChatGPT bc im fkng lazy but it is working flawlessly (yup, some eng youtubers don't like to die during their 100-days run. Lol).

The script makes a copy of the save folder into a "Backups" folder that will be created in the save folder. "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Zomboid\Saves". The backup folder will have a date and time, and the save will have the original name, so you can just drop it.

You have to change which game mode you want to backup (Sandbox, Apocalypse ...) as it has Sandbox as default. If I have some time I will update it to allow the user to select the game mode, not now.
